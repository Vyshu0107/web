  <h1>DANCE</h1>
  <p>All in all, dance is something which anyone can do. There is no right way or wrong way to dance, there is just a dance. 
    The only hard part is taking the first step, after that, everything becomes easier. So, we must always dance our heart out and let our body move to the rhythm of music freely.
